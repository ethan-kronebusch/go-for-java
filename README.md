# GO For Java

## Overview
This is a recreation of the classic game Go in Java. I created it as my final project for a Software Engineering course in college.
It contains a fully-featured GUI through which you can play the game.

## Features
- Black and white scoring
- Nice looking buttons and interface
- Passing and forfeiture logic

## Usage
Download the file from the [Releases](https://github.com/ethan-kronebusch/go-for-java/releases/tag/v1.0) page.
Double click on the .jar file or run `java -jar <filename>` to get started.
Refer to the [Go Rules](https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html) if you need further guidance.
